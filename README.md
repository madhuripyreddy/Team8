## Project Description: 

 This is a mobile application that will help patients schedule their appointments with doctors online. This platform is for patients who are unable to see their doctor in person to schedule their appointments. This app would interface with their local hospitals, providing the patients the option of reserving their online appointments based on their preferred days and times. Patients that want to reserve their appointments with their doctors can use the software to schedule/reschedule the appointments remotely and at their convenience. 


## Features implemented for User, Dealer, Admin: 

 For this app, we created a home page in which the app user can access his/her information as User, Dealer, and Admin. For User, Dealer, and Admin, they all can login to access their dashboards or logout out of their dashboards. If they donâ€™t have an account, they can register by clicking on the Register button of the Login forms provided. If they forgot the password for any reason, they have the option of filling out the form in which they are able to reclaim the password. 

User: Profile Page, Settings Page, Calendar and Reservation, Search, Contact Us, About Us, Bill, Logout 

Dealer: Appointment Page, Patient Chart, Medications, Logout

Admin: Modify Bill, Account Search, Logout

## Languages/Technologies: 

Java, XML, Android Studio, SQLite, Firebase
